This website details computational analyses done on my thesis project, which utilizes Hi-C to find 3-dimensional regulatory differences between humans and chimpanzees. Click on any of the links below to jump to that section of the analysis:

*  Reading in of the data and initial quality control metrics
*  Linear modeling of the data to find quantitative contact differences between humans and chimpanzees
*  Easier to build and extend the website using the new tools in the [rmarkdown][] package and [latest RStudio release][rstudio]
*  Easier to deploy the website with Git and GitHub by only using one branch
